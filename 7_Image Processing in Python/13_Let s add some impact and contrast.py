#Let's add some impact and contrast
#Have you ever wanted to enhance the contrast of your photos so that they appear more dramatic?
#
#In this exercise, you'll increase the contrast of a cup of coffee. Something you could share with your friends on social media. Don't forget to use #ImageProcessingDatacamp as hashtag!
#
#Even though this is not our Sunday morning coffee cup, you can still apply the same methods to any of our photos.
#
#A function called show_image(), that displays an image using Matplotlib, has already been defined. It has the arguments image and title, with title being 'Original' by default.

#ImageProcessingDatacamp

# Import the necessary modules
from skimage import data, exposure

# Load the image
original_image = data.coffee()

# Apply the adaptive equalization on the original image
adapthist_eq_image = exposure.equalize_adapthist(original_image, clip_limit=0.03)

# Compare the original image to the equalized
show_image(original_image)
show_image(adapthist_eq_image, '#ImageProcessingDatacamp')

#mejora notablemente el color y contraste de la imagén 
#Amazing! You have increased the contrast of the image using an algorithm for local contrast enhancement, that uses histograms computed over different tile regions of the image. Local details can therefore be enhanced even in regions that are darker or lighter than the rest of the image.
