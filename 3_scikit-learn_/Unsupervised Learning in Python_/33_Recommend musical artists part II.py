#Recommend musical artists part II
#Suppose you were a big fan of Bruce Springsteen - which other musicial artists might you like? Use your NMF features from the previous exercise and the cosine similarity to find similar musical artists. A solution to the previous exercise has been run, so norm_features is an array containing the normalized NMF features as rows. The names of the musical artists are available as the list artist_names.

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(norm_features, index=artist_names)

# Select row of 'Bruce Springsteen': artist
artist = df.loc['Bruce Springsteen']

# Compute cosine similarities: similarities
similarities = df.dot(artist)

# Display those with highest cosine similarity
print(similarities.nlargest())


#Answer

Bruce Springsteen    1.000000
Neil Young           0.955896
Van Morrison         0.872452
Leonard Cohen        0.864763
Bob Dylan            0.859047
