#Clustering Wikipedia part I
#You saw in the video that TruncatedSVD is able to perform PCA on sparse arrays in csr_matrix format, such as word-frequency arrays. Combine your knowledge of TruncatedSVD and k-means to cluster some popular pages from Wikipedia. In this exercise, build the pipeline. In the next exercise, you'll apply it to the word-frequency array of some Wikipedia articles.
#
#Create a Pipeline object consisting of a TruncatedSVD followed by KMeans. (This time, we've precomputed the word-frequency matrix for you, so there's no need for a TfidfVectorizer).
#
#The Wikipedia dataset you will be working with was obtained from here.

# Perform the necessary imports
from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

# Create a TruncatedSVD instance: svd
svd = TruncatedSVD(n_components=50)

# Create a KMeans instance: kmeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=6)

# Create a pipeline: pipeline
pipeline = make_pipeline(svd,kmeans)


#Excellent! Now that you have set up your pipeline, you will use it in the next exercise to cluster the articles.
