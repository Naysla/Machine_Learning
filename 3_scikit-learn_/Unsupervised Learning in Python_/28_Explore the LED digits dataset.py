#Explore the LED digits dataset
#In the following exercises, you'll use NMF to decompose grayscale images into their commonly occurring patterns. Firstly, explore the image dataset and see how it is encoded as an array. You are given 100 images as a 2D array samples, where each row represents a single 13x8 image. The images in your dataset are pictures of a LED digital display.

# Import pyplot
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
#import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Select the 0th row: digit
digit = samples[0,:]

# Print digit
print(digit)

# Reshape digit to a 13,8x8 array: bitmap
bitmap = digit.reshape(13,8)

# Print bitmap
print(bitmap)

# Use plt.imshow to display bitmap
plt.imshow(bitmap, cmap='gray', interpolation='nearest')
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()


#Answer
#grafica los pixeles especificados enla matriz de resultado

#Excellent job! You'll explore this dataset further in the next exercise and see for yourself how NMF can learn the parts of images.
