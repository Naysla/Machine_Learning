#t-SNE visualization of grain dataset
#In the video, you saw t-SNE applied to the iris dataset. In this exercise, you'll apply t-SNE to the grain samples data and inspect the resulting t-SNE features using a scatter plot. You are given an array samples of grain samples and a list variety_numbers giving the variety number of each grain sample.


# Import TSNE
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE

# Create a TSNE instance: model
model = TSNE(learning_rate=200)

# Apply fit_transform to samples: tsne_features
tsne_features = model.fit_transform(samples)

# Select the 0th feature: xs
xs = tsne_features[:,0]

# Select the 1st feature: ys
ys = tsne_features[:,1]

# Scatter plot, coloring by variety_numbers
plt.scatter(xs, ys, c=variety_numbers) 
plt.show()


#Excellent! As you can see, the t-SNE visualization manages to separate the 3 varieties of grain samples. But how will it perform on the stock data? You'll find out in the next exercise!
