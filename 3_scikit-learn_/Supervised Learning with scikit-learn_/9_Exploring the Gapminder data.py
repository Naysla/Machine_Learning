#Exploring the Gapminder data
#
#As always, it is important to explore your data before building models. On the right, we have constructed a heatmap showing the correlation between the different features of the Gapminder dataset, which has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame as df and is available for exploration in the IPython Shell. Cells that are in green show positive correlation, while cells that are in red show negative correlation. Take a moment to explore this: Which features are positively correlated with life, and which ones are negatively correlated? Does this match your intuition?
#
#Then, in the IPython Shell, explore the DataFrame using pandas methods such as .info(), .describe(), .head().
#
#In case you are curious, the heatmap was generated using Seaborn's heatmap function and the following line of code, where df.corr() computes the pairwise correlation between columns:
#
#sns.heatmap(df.corr(), square=True, cmap='RdYlGn')
#
#Once you have a feel for the data, consider the statements below and select the one that is not true. After this, Hugo will explain the mechanics of linear regression in the next video and you will be on your way building regression models!

df.info()
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 139 entries, 0 to 138
Data columns (total 9 columns):
population         139 non-null float64
fertility          139 non-null float64
HIV                139 non-null float64
CO2                139 non-null float64
BMI_male           139 non-null float64
GDP                139 non-null float64
BMI_female         139 non-null float64
life               139 non-null float64
child_mortality    139 non-null float64
dtypes: float64(9)
memory usage: 9.9 KB


Good job! As seen by using df.info(), fertility, along with all the other columns, is of type float64, not int64.
