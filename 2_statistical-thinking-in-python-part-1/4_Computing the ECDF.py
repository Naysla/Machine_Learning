#Computing the ECDF
#In this exercise, you will write a function that takes as input a 1D array of data and then returns the x and y values of the ECDF. You will use this function over and over again throughout this course and its sequel. ECDFs are among the most important plots in statistical analysis. You can write your own function, foo(x,y) according to the following skeleton:
#
#def foo(a,b):
#    """State what function does here"""
#    # Computation performed here
#    return x, y
#The function foo() above takes two arguments a and b and returns two values x and y. The function header def foo(a,b): contains the function signature foo(a,b), which consists of the function name, along with its parameters. For more on writing your own functions, see DataCamp's course Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1) here!

def ecdf(data):
    """Compute ECDF for a one-dimensional array of measurements."""
    # Number of data points: n
    n = len(data)
    
    # x-data for the ECDF: x
    x = np.sort(data)
 
    # y-data for the ECDF: y
    y = np.arange(1,n+1) / n

# Compute ECDF for versicolor data: x_vers, y_vers
#Unpack the output into
x_vers, y_vers = ecdf(versicolor_petal_length)

# Generate plot
_ = plt.plot(x_vers, y_vers, marker = '.', linestyle = 'none')
 

# Label the axes
_ = plt.xlabel('petal lengths') 
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF') 


# Display the plot
plt.show()
	
	
	
	# devuelve una grafica de puntos
