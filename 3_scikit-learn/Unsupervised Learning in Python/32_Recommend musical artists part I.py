#Recommend musical artists part I
#In this exercise and the next, you'll use what you've learned about NMF to recommend popular music artists! You are given a sparse array artists whose rows correspond to artists and whose column correspond to users. The entries give the number of times each artist was listened to by each user.
#
#In this exercise, build a pipeline and transform the array into normalized NMF features. The first step in the pipeline, MaxAbsScaler, transforms the data so that all users have the same influence on the model, regardless of how many different artists they've listened to. In the next exercise, you'll use the resulting normalized NMF features for recommendation!

# Perform the necessary imports
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF
from sklearn.preprocessing import MaxAbsScaler, Normalizer
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

# Create a MaxAbsScaler: scaler
scaler = MaxAbsScaler()

# Create an NMF model: nmf
nmf = NMF(n_components=20)

# Create a Normalizer: normalizer
normalizer = Normalizer()

# Create a pipeline: pipeline
pipeline = make_pipeline(scaler, nmf, normalizer)

# Apply fit_transform to artists: norm_features
norm_features = pipeline.fit_transform(artists)


#Answer

#Excellent work - now that you've computed the normalized NMF features, you'll use them in the next exercise to recommend musical artists!
