#Generate a Random Walk
#Whereas stock returns are often modeled as white noise, stock prices closely follow a random walk. In other words, today's price is yesterday's price plus some random noise.
#
#You will simulate the price of a stock over time that has a starting price of 100 and every day goes up or down by a random amount. Then, plot the simulated stock price. If you hit the "Run Code" code button multiple times, you'll see several realizations.

# Generate 500 random steps with mean=0 and standard deviation=1
steps = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=500)

# Set first element to 0 so that the first price will be the starting stock price
steps[0]=0

# Simulate stock prices, P with a starting price of 100
P = 100 + np.cumsum(steps)

# Plot the simulated stock prices
plt.plot(P)
plt.title("Simulated Random Walk")
plt.show()

#The simulated price series you plotted should closely resemble a random walk.
