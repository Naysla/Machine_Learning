#Get the Drift
#In the last exercise, you simulated stock prices that follow a random walk. You will extend this in two ways in this exercise.
#
#You will look at a random walk with a drift. Many time series, like stock prices, are random walks but tend to drift up over time.
#In the last exercise, the noise in the random walk was additive: random, normal changes in price were added to the last price. However, when adding noise, you could theoretically get negative prices. Now you will make the noise multiplicative: you will add one to the random, normal changes to get a total return, and multiply that by the last price.

# Generate 500 random steps
steps = np.random.normal(loc=0.001, scale=0.01, size=500) + 1

# Set first element to 1
steps[0]=1

# Simulate the stock price, P, by taking the cumulative product
P = 100 * np.cumprod(steps)

# Plot the simulated stock prices
plt.plot(P)
plt.title("Simulated Random Walk with Drift")
plt.show()

#This simulated price series you plotted should closely resemble a random walk for a high flying stock
