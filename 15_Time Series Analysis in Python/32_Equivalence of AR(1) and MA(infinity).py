#Equivalence of AR(1) and MA(infinity)
#To better understand the relationship between MA models and AR models, you will demonstrate that an AR(1) model is equivalent to an MA(∞) model with the appropriate parameters.
#
#You will simulate an MA model with parameters 0.8,0.82,0.83,… for a large number (30) lags and show that it has the same Autocorrelation Function as an AR(1) model with ϕ=0.8.
#
#Note, to raise a number x to the power of an exponent n, use the format x**n.

# import the modules for simulating data and plotting the ACF
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_process import ArmaProcess
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf

# Build a list MA parameters
ma = [0.8**i for i in range(30)]


# Simulate the MA(30) model
ar = np.array([1])
AR_object = ArmaProcess(ar, ma)
simulated_data = AR_object.generate_sample(nsample=5000)

# Plot the ACF
plot_acf(simulated_data, lags=30)
plt.show()

#Notice that the ACF looks the same as an AR(1) with parameter 0.8
