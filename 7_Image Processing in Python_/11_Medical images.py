#Medical images
#You are trying to improve the tools of a hospital by pre-processing the X-ray images so that doctors have a higher chance of spotting relevant details. You'll test our code on a chest X-ray image from the National Institutes of Health Chest X-Ray Dataset
#			Image loaded as chest_xray_image.
#First, you'll check the histogram of the image and then apply standard histogram equalization to improve the contrast. Remember we obtain the histogram by using the hist() function from Matplotlib, which has been already imported as plt.

# Import the required module
from skimage import exposure

# Show original x-ray image and its histogram
show_image(chest_xray_image, 'Original x-ray')

plt.title('Histogram of image')
plt.hist(chest_xray_image.ravel(), bins=256)
plt.show()

# Use histogram equalization to improve the contrast
xray_image_eq =  exposure.equalize_hist(chest_xray_image)

# Show the resulting image
show_image(xray_image_eq, 'Resulting image')

#Great job! Now you can apply this code and knowledge to other similar images.
