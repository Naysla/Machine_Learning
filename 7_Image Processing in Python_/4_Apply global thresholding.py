#Apply global thresholding
#In this exercise, you'll transform a photograph to binary so you can separate the foreground from the background.
#
#To do so, you need to import the required modules, load the image, obtain the optimal thresh value using threshold_otsu() and apply it to the image.
#
#You'll see the resulting binarized image when using the show_image() function, previously explained.
#
#Remember we have to turn colored images to grayscale. For that we will use the rgb2gray() function learned in previous video. Which has already been imported for you.


# Import the otsu threshold function
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu

# Make the image grayscale using rgb2gray
chess_pieces_image_gray = rgb2gray(chess_pieces_image)

# Obtain the optimal threshold value with otsu
thresh = threshold_otsu(chess_pieces_image_gray)

# Apply thresholding to the image
binary = chess_pieces_image_gray > thresh

# Show the image
show_image(binary, 'Binary image')

#Separa elprimer plano del plano del fondo muestra la imagen en escala de grises

#Awesome! You just converted the image to binary and we can separate the foreground from the background.
