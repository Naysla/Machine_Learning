#Less corners
#In this exercise, you will test what happens when you set the minimum distance between corner peaks to be a higher number. Remember you do this with the min_distance attribute parameter of the corner_peaks() function.
#
#	Image preloaded as building_image.
#The functions show_image(), show_image_with_corners() and required packages have already been preloaded for you. As well as all the previous code for finding the corners. The Harris measure response image obtained with corner_harris() is preloaded as measure_image.

# Find the peaks with a min distance of 2 pixels
coords_w_min_2 = corner_peaks(measure_image, min_distance=2)
print("With a min_distance set to 2, we detect a total", len(coords_w_min_2), "corners in the image.")

# Find the peaks with a min distance of 40 pixels
coords_w_min_40 = corner_peaks(measure_image, min_distance=40)
print("With a min_distance set to 40, we detect a total", len(coords_w_min_40), "corners in the image.")


#With a min_distance set to 2, we detect a total 98 corners in the image.
#With a min_distance set to 40, we detect a total 36 corners in the image.
