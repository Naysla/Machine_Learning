#What is the goal of the algorithm?
#As you know from previous courses, there are different types of supervised machine learning problems. In this exercise you will tell us what type of supervised machine learning problem this is, and why you think so.
#
#Remember, your goal is to correctly label budget line items by training a supervised model to predict the probability of each possible label, taking most probable label as the correct label.

#Answer

#Clasificación, porque las probabilidades predichas se usarán para seleccionar una clase de etiqueta.

#Classification, because predicted probabilities will be used to select a label class

#Nice! Specifically, we have ourselves a multi-class-multi-label classification problem (quite a mouthful!), because there are 9 broad categories that each take on many possible sub-label instances.
