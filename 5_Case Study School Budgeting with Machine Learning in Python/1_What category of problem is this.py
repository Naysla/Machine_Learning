#What category of problem is this?
#You're no novice to data science, but let's make sure we agree on the basics.

#As Peter from DrivenData explained in the video, you're going to be working with school district budget data. This data can be classified in many ways according to certain labels, e.g. Function: Career & Academic Counseling, or Position_Type: Librarian.
#
#Your goal is to develop a model that predicts the probability for each possible label by relying on some correctly labeled examples.
#
#What type of machine learning problem is this?
#Answer
#Aprendizaje supervisado, porque el modelo será entrenado usando ejemplos etiquetados.

#Supervised Learning, because the model will be trained using labeled examples. --> ok

#Yes! Using correctly labeled budget line items to train means this is a supervised learning problem.
