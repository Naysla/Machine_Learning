#Aggregating II
#To get you familiar with more of the built in aggregation methods, here's a few more exercises involving the flights table!
#
#Remember, a SparkSession called spark is already in your workspace, along with the Spark DataFrame flights.

# Average duration of Delta flights
flights.filter(flights.carrier=="DL").filter(flights.origin=="SEA").groupBy().avg("air_time").show()

# Total hours in the air
flights.withColumn("duration_hrs", flights.air_time/60).groupBy().sum("duration_hrs").show()

#Stellar job! Now you can answer some interesting questions about the data.
