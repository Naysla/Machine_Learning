#Forecasting with an AR Model
#In addition to estimating the parameters of a model that you did in the last exercise, you can also do forecasting, both in-sample and out-of-sample using statsmodels. The in-sample is a forecast of the next data point using the data up to that point, and the out-of-sample forecasts any number of data points in the future. These forecasts can be made using either the predict() method if you want the forecasts in the form of a series of data, or using the plot_predict() method if you want a plot of the forecasted data. You supply the starting point for forecasting and the ending point, which can be any number of data points after the data set ends.
#
#For the simulated series simulated_data_1 with Ï•=0.9, you will plot in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts.

# Import the ARMA module from statsmodels
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARMA

# Forecast the first AR(1) model
mod = ARMA(simulated_data_1, order=(1,0))
res = mod.fit()
res.plot_predict(start=990, end=1010)
plt.show()

#Notice how, when phi is high like here, the forecast gradually moves to the long term mean of zero, but if phi were low, it would move much quicker to the long term mean. Try it out and see for yourself!
