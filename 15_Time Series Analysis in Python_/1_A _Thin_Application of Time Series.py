#A "Thin" Application of Time Series
#Google Trends (https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=CO) allows users to see how often a term is searched for. We downloaded a file from Google Trends containing the frequency over time for the search word "diet", which is pre-loaded in a DataFrame called diet. A first step when analyzing a time series is to visualize the data with a plot. You should be able to clearly see a gradual decrease in searches for "diet" throughout the calendar year, hitting a low around the December holidays, followed by a spike in searches around the new year as people make New Year's resolutions to lose weight.
#
#Like many time series datasets you will be working with, the index of dates are strings and should be converted to a datetime index before plotting.

#This course touches on a lot of concepts you may have forgotten, so if you ever need a quick refresher, download the pandas basics Cheat Sheet and keep it handy!

# Import pandas and plotting modules
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Convert the date index to datetime
diet.index = pd.to_datetime(diet.index)

# Plot the entire time series diet and show gridlines
diet.plot(grid=True)
plt.show()

# Slice the dataset to keep only 2012
diet2012 = diet['2012']

# Plot 2012 data
diet2012.plot(grid=True)
plt.show()
