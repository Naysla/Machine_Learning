#Simulate AR(1) Time Series
#You will simulate and plot a few AR(1) time series, each with a different parameter, ϕ, using the arima_process module in statsmodels. In this exercise, you will look at an AR(1) model with a large positive ϕ and a large negative ϕ, but feel free to play around with your own parameters.
#
#There are a few conventions when using the arima_process module that require some explanation. First, these routines were made very generally to handle both AR and MA models. We will cover MA models next, so for now, just ignore the MA part. Second, when inputting the coefficients, you must include the zero-lag coefficient of 1, and the sign of the other coefficients is opposite what we have been using (to be consistent with the time series literature in signal processing). For example, for an AR(1) process with ϕ=0.9, the array representing the AR parameters would be ar = np.array([1, -0.9])

# import the module for simulating data
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_process import ArmaProcess

# Plot 1: AR parameter = +0.9
plt.subplot(2,1,1)
ar1 = np.array([1, -0.9])
ma1 = np.array([1])
AR_object1 = ArmaProcess(ar1, ma1)
simulated_data_1 = AR_object1.generate_sample(nsample=1000)
plt.plot(simulated_data_1)

# Plot 2: AR parameter = -0.9
plt.subplot(2,1,2)
ar2 = np.array([1, 0.9])
ma2 = np.array([1])
AR_object2 = ArmaProcess(ar2, ma2)
simulated_data_2 = AR_object2.generate_sample(nsample=1000)
plt.plot(simulated_data_2)
plt.show()

#The two AR parameters produce very different looking time series plots, but in the next exercise you'll really be able to distinguish the time series
