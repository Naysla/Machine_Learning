#Can't Forecast White Noise
#A white noise time series is simply a sequence of uncorrelated random variables that are identically distributed. Stock returns are often modeled as white noise. Unfortunately, for white noise, we cannot forecast future observations based on the past - autocorrelations at all lags are zero.
#
#You will generate a white noise series and plot the autocorrelation function to show that it is zero for all lags. You can use np.random.normal() to generate random returns. For a Gaussian white noise process, the mean and standard deviation describe the entire process.
#
#Plot this white noise series to see what it looks like, and then plot the autocorrelation function.

# Import the plot_acf module from statsmodels
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf

# Simulate white noise returns
returns = np.random.normal(loc=0.02, scale=0.05, size=1000)

# Print out the mean and standard deviation of returns
mean = np.mean(returns)
std = np.std(returns)
print("The mean is %5.3f and the standard deviation is %5.3f" %(mean,std))

# Plot returns series
plt.plot(returns)
plt.show()

# Plot autocorrelation function of white noise returns
plot_acf(returns, lags=20)
plt.show()

#The mean is 0.018 and the standard deviation is 0.050
# la gr√°fica muestra el rango menor a 1 como en el ejemplo del video y se encuentra en un rango de 20
#Notice that for a white noise time series, all the autocorrelations are close to zero, so the past will not help you forecast the future.
