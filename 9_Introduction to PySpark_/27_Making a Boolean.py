#Making a Boolean
#Consider that you're modeling a yes or no question: is the flight late? However, your data contains the arrival delay in minutes for each flight. Thus, you'll need to create a boolean column which indicates whether the flight was late or not!

# Create is_late
model_data = model_data.withColumn("is_late", model_data.arr_delay > 0)

# Convert to an integer
model_data = model_data.withColumn("label", model_data.is_late.cast("integer"))

# Remove missing values
model_data = model_data.filter("arr_delay is not NULL and dep_delay is not NULL and air_time is not NULL and plane_year is not NULL")

#Awesome! Now you've defined the column that you're going to use as the outcome in your model.
